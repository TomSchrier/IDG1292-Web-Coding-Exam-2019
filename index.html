                <h2>Welcome to NTNU Design Gjøvik</h2>
                <p>The word <strong>"design"</strong> covers a fairly wide range of activities, professions, and
                    disciplines. We tend to
                    say
                    <q>Put 10 designers around a table and you get 20 opinions on what design is.</q> At <abbr
                        title="Norwegian University of Science and Technology">NTNU</abbr> we
                    have a quite
                    clear
                    image
                    of what we want to stand for: contribute to creating a <em>better</em> world, not only through
                    knowledge but
                    also
                    through its application, with focus on the link between technology and the human individual as the
                    user,
                    consumer or stakeholder. Technology can be anything from digital to material, a person can be
                    regarded
                    as an
                    individual or as part of a group or community, and the link can be between products, services or
                    systems.

                    advanced and robust web solutions and work creatively and systematically to develop innovative
                    concepts for the web. You should want to take loose formulas from a customer and develop this into a

                <h2>Designing at NTNU</h2>
                <p>Two areas of graphic design are emphasized: typography with a focus on writing and editorial design,
                    and information design with a focus on information graphics, information architecture, and
                    user-centered design methods. The students end up with a comprehensive and elaborate folder of
                    practical design projects, which after three years of study are the starting point for the students'
                    graduation exhibition.</p>
