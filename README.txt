Student nr. 522959

I have chosen to follow Mozilla's documentation "Dealing with files" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) to decide what structure my site should have. It consists of index.html, and two other folders, assets, and scripts.

-The assets folder includes fonts, images, and SVG icons used throughout the entire web site. 

-The scripts folder includes three JavaScript-files provided by Carlos Vicient Monllao. Full credit to the author.

-As suggested by the coursework description I have renamed my root folder to a random name to avoid plagiarism issues.

***ICONS***
I have used icons from Google Material Design Icon library https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=round

***PHOTOS***
I have used photos from multiple sources, I have made sure that the images can be reused in this project.

***DEVELOPMENT***
I want to emphasize that I used Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition Browser when creating and testing this site. If anything looks out of place or wrong, it might be worth it to take a look with Firefox/Firefox Developer Edition to see if the problem continues to exist.

***COMMENTS***
I have tried to comment most of the code to make it easier to understand, not just for others, but also for me if I come back to this code later in time.
